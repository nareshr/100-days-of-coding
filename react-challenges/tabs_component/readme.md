Tabs Component
Build a component Tabs that displays a list of tabs for either viewing information about a person or viewing information about an address.

You should make the tab functional so that when the tab Person is active then return the PersonContainer with all its children. Implement the same logic for the Address tab.

We have already written some starting code along with styles for you. Your code should work as shown in the below GIF.
